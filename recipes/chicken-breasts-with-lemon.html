    <h3>A recipe by Pierre Franey of The New York Times</h3>
    <p>In this recipe, which Pierre Franey brought to The Times in 1992 in one of his 60-Minute Gourmet columns, two teaspoons of lemon zest are added to a simple sauce of lemon juice, thyme, garlic and shallots. It is, at once, lively and elegant. To round it out, it needs a sturdy accompaniment. Mr. Franey suggested mashed potatoes with garlic and basil, with just a little olive oil swirled in.</p>

    <h4 class="solid-divider">INGREDIENTS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup flour for dredging</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 skinless boneless chicken breasts, about 6 ounces each</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth, fresh or canned</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="solid-divider">STEPS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Season flour with salt and pepper, and dredge the chicken all over. Remove the excess flour.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large enough to hold the chicken pieces in one layer. Add chicken and cook, uncovered, over medium heat for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Flip the chicken and cook for 5 minutes more, or until cooked through. Carefully remove the oil from the skillet, leaving the chicken. Discard the oil.</li>
        <li>Add the thyme, shallots and garlic, and cook for about a minute. Do not burn the garlic. Add the lemon rind, the lemon juice and the broth.</li>
        <li>Scrape the skillet to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the bottom. Add the butter, and cook for 3 minutes longer. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
