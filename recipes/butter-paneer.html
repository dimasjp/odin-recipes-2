    <h1>Chicken Breasts with Lemon</h1>

    <h2>A recipe by Zainab Shah of The New York Times</h2>
    <p>Paneer cubes are cooked in three types of fat here: ghee, butter and cashew butter for a luxurious vegetarian main. Traditionally, roasted and crushed cashews are puréed with cooked onions and tomatoes, but this version skips the hassle and achieves the same creamy, nutty richness. Red chile and fresh Thai green chiles layer in a touch of heat. Substitute firm tofu for paneer to make the dish vegan, and spoon the leftovers over noodles for another meal.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ pounds paneer, cut into ½-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee or vegetable, canola or other neutral oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger or ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated garlic or garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 small white onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chile powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can of crushed tomatoes, or 6 plum tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cashew butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 Thai green chiles, chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped cilantro (optional)</li>
        <li>Rice or roti, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If using store-bought paneer, soak the cheese in hot tap water for 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>In a medium pot, heat ghee on high until it melts, 30 to 90 seconds. Stir in ginger and garlic and cook until the smell of raw garlic dissipates, about 30 seconds. Add onion and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chile powder and half of the garam masala and cook until deliciously fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the tomatoes and cashew butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes start to break down, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Adjust heat to medium and add the butter. Cook until butter has melted into the mixture, about 30 seconds. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt and add water if a thinner sauce is desired. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Stir in the paneer cubes. Simmer for 5 minutes on low, until the flavors have melded. Top with the rest of the garam masala and the green chiles and cilantro, if using. Serve with rice or roti.</li>
    </ol>
